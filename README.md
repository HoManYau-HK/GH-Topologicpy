# GH-Topologicpy

Starting with a Why not?
Since because of the limitation of GH-Topologic, which I think its mainly able to visualise graphs but not further develop them. 
If it is possible to link GH-python to VS code. Or using Topologicpy in Grasshopper-Python.


#I want to avoid the obj mesh import to TopologicPY (VSC).
